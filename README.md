## ‚ú® Steps

- **Data Preparation**
  - Load, explore, and clean your dataset.
  - Normalize features for effective model training.

- **Model Development**
  - Train machine learning models on imbalanced datasets.
  - Apply data balancing techniques such as SMOTE and ADASYN.
  - Evaluate model performance using ROC curves and accuracy metrics.

- **Visualization**
  - Compare model performance with and without oversampling.
  - Generate visual insights for better interpretability.
